# Week3-NewtonRaphsonFractals
Basic code for Fractal plotting.

You will notice that this code is very slow, partly because of the 
large number of points being plotted, but mostly because it is 
not written very efficiently. 
See the repo Week3-FasterFractals for a walk-through of how to 
speed it up.

What this version has (that the faster one doesn't), is that it shows 
how to use a different color palette (called "viridis", but there are 
many others available), instead of the default R palette.
This allows much more beautiful pictures to be created.
